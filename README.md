### Evolving Soft Robot Morphologies with Generative Diffusion Models
This Git repository contains the code developed for my Bachelor's thesis on evolving soft robot morphologies using generative diffusion models. The thesis is included in the repository for reference (see "BA_John_Stewardson.pdf"). You can read the thesis for a detailed explanation of the research and methods used, and explore the code to inspect the implementation of the models and experiments.

### Setup Instructions

1. **Set Up EvoGym**  
   Follow the official EvoGym setup instructions provided on the [EvoGym GitHub page](https://github.com/EvolutionGym/evogym) to get EvoGym up and running on your system.

2. **Place Diffusion Files**  
   Once EvoGym is set up, copy the `diffusion_v4` folder into the `examples` directory within the EvoGym repository.

3. **Inspecting Results**  
   The results of previous experiments can be inspected in the `imported_exp_data` folder, which contains the robots for the Walker-v0 task, using approaches such as CPPN, GA, and GDA.
